== What is a Property Graph?

*Directed, binary, attributed multi-graph*

* Vertices
* Edges
* Properties

[.notes]
--
Mathematically, we can define a property graph as a directed, binary, attributed multi-graph.
It consists of a set of vertices, a multi-set of directed, binary edges, and key-value pairs
or properties associated with vertices and edges.

== Vertices

*Vertex id and label*

[.notes]
--
Each vertex in a property graph has a unique id that is either assigned automatically by DSE Graph
or is a custom id specified by a graph creator. Each vertex also has a label that
generally denotes a type of an entity that a vertex represents.

In this illustration, we have 7 vertices with labels _movie_, _person_, _user_, and _genre_.
All of the vertices have unique ids, such as _m267_ or _p4361_. It is convenient for us to think of ids as
simple strings in this example but, in reality, vertex ids in DSE Graph are composed of multiple components used not only for
uniqueness but also for graph partitioning. We will revisit ids again when we talk about custom ids.

== Edges

*Edge direction and label*

[.notes]
--
Each (binary) edge connects exactly two vertices. Edges are always directed, have automatically assigned unique
identifiers and have labels. Since a property graph is a multi-graph, it is possible to have
multiple edges connecting the same two vertices; such parallel edges may have the same direction and labels but will
have different ids.

In this illustration, we connected our vertices with labeled edges. Edges and their labels usually
denote relationships between entities represented by vertices. It is getting more interesting!
We can now read that _some user u185 rated movie m267 that has some actor p4361_.

== Properties

*Vertex and edge properties*

[.notes]
--
Properties are key/value pairs that can be associated with any vertex or edge in a property graph.
They describe individual vertices (entities) and edges (relashionships).

Our sample graph now contains a lot of useful information. Read it.

Note that ids denoted by _movieId_, _userId_, _personId_, and _genreId_ are really the properties
that we decided to create for our vertices. They are different from vertex ids shown inside of circles. We will
rely on property ids rather than vertex ids in many of our examples to distinguish vertices.

== Multi-Properties

*Vertex properties with multiple values*

[.notes]
--
A vertex property that can have multiple values is called _multi-property_.

In this example, we have _production_ and _budget_ as multi-properties and show their values in square
brackets. Another way to think about them is having multiple key-value pairs with the same key
(e.g., _budget: $150M_ and _budget: $200M_).

Note that multi-properties are only applicable to vertices and not to edges.
--


== Meta-Properties

*Properties describing vertex properties*

image::{image_path}/meta-property.svg[float="center"]

[.notes]
--
A property that can be assigned to a vertex property is called _meta-property_. Meta-properties
are usually used for describing access control, provenance and audit information for individual
vertex properties.

In this example, we have meta-properties describing provenance of two movie budget estimates, as well as
meta-properties describing access control permissions for the person properties.

Note that meta-properties are only applicable to vertex properties and not to edge properties.
A meta-property cannot be a multi-property or have meta-properties assigned to it.

Here is our final graph example with all the discussed components.
Not too simple, not too difficult.
Any questions?

* Subgraph
* Incident edge
* Incoming and outgoing edges
* Adjacent vertex
* Simple, cyclic, and shortest paths
* Vertex degree, in-degree, and out-degree
--

[.notes]

Here are some graph theory terms that you should be comfortable with:

* Subgraph: A subgraph _S_ of a graph _G_ is a graph whose vertices are a subset of the vertex set of _G_, and whose edges are a subset of the edge set of _G_.
* Incident edge: An edge is called incident to a vertex when this vertex is one of the edge endpoints.
* Incoming and outgoing edges: An edge directed in or out of a vertex.
* Adjacent vertex: A vertex _a_ is called adjacent to a vertex _v_ when there exists an edge between the two vertices.
* Path: A sequence of alternating vertices and edges, beginning and ending with vertices, where each edge's endpoints are the preceding and following vertices in the sequence.
* Simple, cyclic, and shortest paths: simple - cannot repeat an edge/vertex; cyclic - repetition and
therefore cycles are ok; shortest length path - a path with the least number of edges.
* Vertex degree, in-degree, and out-degree: a number of incident, incident incoming, and incident outgoing edges; degree = in-degree + out-degree.

The illustration shows a subgraph of the original graph we saw previously with 5 vertices and 4 edges.
Vertex _m267_ has 4 incident edges (1 incoming and 3 outgoing) and 4 adjacent vertices. Only simple
paths exist in this subgraph.

This is only to get us started! There will be a plenty of new notions introduced gradually.
