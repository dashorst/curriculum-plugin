Gremlin is a graph traversal language defined by Apache TinkerPop.

Gremlin is a very expressive language to work with graphs and is used in
many other graph databases besides DSE Graph.

Gremlin is a functional language with a fluent interface and bindings
in Groovy, Java8, Scala, Closure, Ruby, JavaScript, and other programming languages.

== Defining Gremlin Traversals

g.
  V().
  has("title","Alice in Wonderland").
  has("year",2010).
  out("director").
  values("name")

// Sample output:
// Tim Burton

As an example, consider this traversal that starts with the vertex representing the movie
titled _Alice in Wonderland_
and released in _2010_. We want to traverse all outgoing edges with label _director_ and
find values of movie's director names. In this case, _title_, _year_, and _name_ are vertex properties.

This traversal is defined as a sequence of steps, namely _V_ -> _has_ -> _has_ -> _out_ -> _values_.
It is said to have a _linear motif_.

Note that _g_ represents a traversal source that "knows" about both the property graph and traversal engine
to be used for this traversal.

The illustration on the right shows how an object called _traverser_ (green running gremlin)
is propagating to unify the graph and the traversal.

*Nested motif: Traversal is a tree of steps*

g.
  V().
  has("title","Alice in Wonderland").
  has("year",2010).
  union(__.out("director"),
           out("screenwriter")).
  values("name")

  // Sample output:
  // Tim Burton
  // Linda Woolverton
--

[.notes]

Here is an example of a traversal with the _nested motif_. Steps are organized into a tree rather
than a sequence. Branching is introduced by _union_ that directs a traverser to adjacent vertices
using outgoing edges labeled with _director_ or _screenwriter_.

We get Tim Burton (director) and Linda Woolverton (screenwriter) in the output.

== Gremlin Traversal Ingredients

* Traversal source

[source]
--
     g = graph.traversal()
--

* Traversal steps

[source]
--
     g.V().has("title","Alice in Wonderland").has("year",2010).out("director").values("name")
--

* Traverser

[.notes]

The three main ingredients of a Gremlin traversal are:

* Traversal source -- created from the property graph _graph_
using the standard, OLTP traversal engine (in this example).

* Traversal steps -- define instructions for the traversal.

* Traverser -- object(s) propagating through the traversal to unify the
graph and the traversal steps.

To become proficient in Gremlin, you can study individual traversal steps.
There are a few dozens of them.

_Lambda steps_ are the foundational constructs of the Gremlin language. They are
most general steps that can be used to implement most other steps. However they
are not the easiest steps in Gremlin to use and are mostly intended
for educational purposes.

_Derived steps_, on the other hand, are useful in practice. Most traversals will typically
rely on around 10 most commonly used steps, so learning all of them is
not necessary to start using Gremlin.

There are also a few steps that do not fall under the lambda/derived classification.

There are _step modulators_ that are used to manipulate an existing step.

Finally, there are predicates that are used to relate values and objects.

== Graph Traversal Step Evaluation

*Becoming proficient in Gremlin*

* Lazy evaluation
** All but _barrier steps_
* Barrier steps
** Collecting barrier steps: _aggregate_, _barrier_, _order_, _sample_
** Reducing barrier steps: _count_, _fold_, _max_, _min_, _sum_
** Supplying barrier step: _cap_

Additionally, steps can be classified based on their lazy and non-lazy evaluation.

Verbatim from the Gremlin docs:
Gremlin is primarily a lazy, stream processing language.
This means that Gremlin fully processes (to the best of its abilities) any traversers currently in the traversal pipeline
before getting more data from the start/head of the traversal.
However, there are numerous situations
in which a completely lazy computation is not possible (or impractical).
When a computation is not lazy, a "barrier step" exists.
There are three types of barriers:

* _CollectingBarrierStep_: All of the traversers prior to the step are put into a collection and then processed in some way (e.g. ordered) prior to the collection being "drained" one-by-one to the next step.
* _ReducingBarrierStep_: All of the traversers prior to the step are processed by a reduce function and once all the previous traversers are processed, a single "reduced value" traverser is emitted to the next step.
* _SupplyingBarrierStep_: All of the traversers prior to the step are iterated (no processing) and then some provided supplier yields a single traverser to continue to the next step.

== Types of Graph Traversals

*Becoming proficient in Gremlin*

* Simple Traversal
* Branching Traversal
* Recursive Traversal
* Path Traversal
* Projecting Traversal
* Centrality Traversal
* Mutating Traversal
* Declarative Traversal
* Domain Specific Traversal

Finally, combining individual steps into traversals of different types is another
good approach to learn the language. We will take this approach for this training.
